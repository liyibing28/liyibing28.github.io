## Abstract

+ present optimizations and efficient implementations of OT and OT extensions in the **semi-honest model**.
+ propose a novel OT protocol with security in the standard model and improve OT extensions with respect to communication complexity, computation complexity, and scalability.
+ 为 Yao and Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson 等人的模型定制了协议，能降低复杂度
+ **experiment:**
> + securely compute a Levenshtein distance circuit with 1.29 billion AND gates at a rate of 1.2 million AND gates per second.
> + demonstrate the importance of correctly implementing OT within secure computation protocols by presenting an attack on the FastGC framework.
